It's been a long to begin my transition to software engineering. Starting from college, I had no clue what I wanted to do. I bounced around from major to major trying things outs. After two years, I decied to stick with business because it was still broad enough for me to switch between a specific career. After gradution, I shortly got an internship in finance, where I quickly learned that I was not made for it. It was quite boring for me to just be working with spreadsheets throughout a whole day. Then I left to try something new, this time I took on sales. Sales was quite enjoyable for a couple years. And then again, I got bored throughout the days. Work was starting to take a toll on my motivation to do anything. I know thats kind of how work generally gets after a while, but I was starting to just be down all the time. And this effected my success in sales as well as my personal life. So in order to try to uplift my life again, I started to research new careers. I started going to school part time, while working to try classes out. And then after asking around with friends about their jobs, web development became one of the most interesting career paths. 

About a year ago, I started to take online courses for web development. First learning about HTML and CSS. I was instantly hooked after I saw the magic that code can produce in a web page. Even the simple code of a web page, with almost barebone stlying amazed me. After some time with learning how to build a basic web page, I moved onto Javascript. Which again opened my mind to what a programming language can do. And especially the problem solving aspect of Javascript. Although very frustrating in trying to solve coding challenges, I was still quite enjoyable to figure out the answers, or even just looking around for hints. This finally lead me to pursue web development full time and begin at a coding bootcamp. 

After a couple twist and turns on trying to get a solid career that I would fully enjoy, I think I finally have found it. As difficult it is to successfullly program projects and web pages, the end result is always worth it. The full process from start to finish is quite fun in a way. To me, programming a project is kind of like solving puzzles. It can be difficult to put the pieces together, but at the end, you are left with a great piece of art to display. I hope to learn a lot throughout the course, and build many projects in the future.
