Finishing up my first project was harder than I even imagined at the start of my software engineering journey. I was tasked with creating a Ruby CLI Gem that would provide data from website, and then give the user the ability to get more details about the information. 

Since I have started the program, I have spent a lot more time at home. And I have recently been thinking about learning new recipes for meals to make at home. After looking through different recipe websites and APIs, I stumbled upon The Cocktail DB. I had some extra bottles at home that I wasn't really drinking, and saw an opporunity where I could use the bottles and hopefully create a solid project.

The website has many options for the URL to use depending on what information people needed. This is where pre planning helped a little in narrowing down the choices for what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted to start with the ingredient list first, then be able to see the cocktails made with the selected ingredient. Finally I would then end up at the recipe for the selected cocktail that sounded interesting.

Navigating through The Cocktail DB webpages I ended up scraping three times to get an ingredient list, cocktails list by name, and cocktail recipe. I then created a class for each objected that I wanted to create. Working my way through this project helped me get a better understanding of Object Relationships and having each of my classes collaborate together. Instantiating a new object from the API was a lot different from the previous labs. And this made me think a lot harder on how they work together. 

The hardest part of this project was working on the actual CLI class. Planning out the structure of how I wanted the program to run, wasn't too bad, but actually getting done to coding it was difficult. Setting up user input and then converting that input to change the URL endpoints for my API was a bit of a struggle. After some searching through google, I figured out to iterate through the selected object class. And then selecting an individual name to lookup the new webpage that I needed to scrape. 

Overall my first project was a great learning experience. Taught me the ability to google to find methods that I couldn't figure out while I was coding, and also seeing new syntax or methods that I didn't learn about yet. Finishing up the project for now is quite a good feeling, but I'm left questioning what I could have done or build uopn as I progress through the course.
