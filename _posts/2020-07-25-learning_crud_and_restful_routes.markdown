Moving on to learning Sinatra after the basics of Ruby was quite an experience. On building my project for the second module, I decided to create a flashcard web app. I wanted to make something that  I could use as another study resource while practicing the material so far. RESTful routes and CRUD functionality were two of the highlights for me in the second module. 

CRUD stands for create, read, update, and destroy. You can create a new object and insert into the database. Be able to read the data based on input parameters. Update the necessary information. And then finally delete a single object, or a whole database. 

RESTful routes provides a clean design pattern that makes it easier to manipulate data. It also gives users and developers a more consistent pattern to follow and work with. It uses HTTP verbs, like get, post, patch, delete, to link resources to controller CRUD actions within a client-side server. The principles of RESTful routes creates a consistent design pattern for both users and developers to follow.  

In connecting both CRUD and RESTful routing can provide a solid structure on building a basic web app. Understanding the HTTP verb with the route, and then connecting to what action to be used gives a developer a great foundation to work with on continuing learning about the web and software development.
